## 10/14/2025 - Planned materials needed  

I did some research into how shuttle feeding machines work and how my project would be built. 

I also looked at the different types of motors, and I have decided on two: one servo turned into a linear actuator for the pushing rod, and two BLDC high speed (~1250kv) motors based on calculations at 12V and a needed exit velcity of about 40m/s to reach the back court in badminton.
