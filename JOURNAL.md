## 10/14/2025 10 AM - Planned materials needed  

I did some research into how shuttle feeding machines work and how my project would be built. 

I also looked at the different types of motors, and I have decided on two: one servo turned into a linear actuator for the pushing rod, and two BLDC high speed (~1250kv) motors based on calculations at 12V and a needed exit velcity of about 40m/s to reach the back court in badminton.

## 10/14/2025 3 PM - Planning + 3d modelling, parts list  

Looked at cheap motor options on Aliexpress. Since BLDC motors need an ESC driver, I found a 2822 1200KV + 30A ESC kit for RC airplanes that was only 15 dollars, and is very affordable and works for the project. I also did some 3d modelling, planning to use a t-bar shape for the 16x16mm square mount of the motors. 

Now, the required 3d printing files would be something like this:
2x wheels
2x brackets
1x main motor mount
1x main base + mount for tube
1x shaft for tripod mount
1x servo actuator mount

Next, I will try to finish modelling the main mount and planning hardware components.

## 10/14/2025 11 PM - Onshape modelling + printing!  

Did more sketching and learned Onshape basics. It's SOOO much freaking better than fusion! But 3d modelling is still pretty difficult.

Also ordered aliexpress parts, found a crazy BLDC + esc motor deal 1200kv. Started printing the servo -> linear actuator components.

## 10/17/2025 - Prototyped linear actuator  

Turns out the gear didn't fit on the linear actuator for the servo. I'm reprinting with a new attachment horn that can fit onto the SG90 servo gears. Also, I continued to take Onshape's beginner modelling course. Did a first attempt at the base of the shuttlecock launcher.
